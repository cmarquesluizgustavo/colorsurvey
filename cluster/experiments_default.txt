# Experiment Configuration List
# 
# This file serves as a template for experiments.txt
# Copy this file to experiments.txt and customize with your experiment paths
# 
# Format: One experiment config path per line (relative to project root)
# Example: experiments/my_experiment_config.json
#
# The actual experiments.txt file is gitignored to keep your local
# experiment configurations separate from the repository

# Example experiments (uncomment and modify as needed):
# experiments/xgb_baseline.json
# experiments/mlp_15colors_baseline.json
# experiments/mlp_129colors_balanced.json
